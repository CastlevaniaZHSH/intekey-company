A Combo to Crack the InteKey file security system. Some times we just want to get our code and time back.

Here in Brisonus, upper class uses a tool called Intekey encript system to encript your source code to specified files.
While in my opinion it is somekind of rude for a software and firmware engineer who put so much time into coding and debugging, without having
the access to his/her own modified classes and objects.

emm, and... This is the project to get your codes back.

Basically,it includes 2 main steps, Let's say a firmware project. 

it converts your .c and .h files to .cCrack and .hCrack files inside those "permitted" softwares, like Matlab,CCES and so on (here we are using Matlab)

Second step, revert .cCrack and .hCrack.
